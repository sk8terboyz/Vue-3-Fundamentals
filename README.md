# Vue-3-Fundamentals

Shane Kennedy

Programming languages: HTML, CSS, VueJS


To better understand Vue and how it works, I created this shopping list app awhile ago. Currently it is not working fully, but I just recently rediscovered I created it. It doesn't make use of any JS files, and I'm not sure if that's to its benefit or if it will cause a problem.

I plan to continue working on it as time goes on to see if I can create this working app without the use of JS files, but obviously JS will still be involved.

*ABOUT THE SHOPPING LIST APP*
I initially created this app to get an understanding of VueJS and how it worked, so I didn't focus to much on making it look the best or anything. Currently its only functionalities are to display hard-coded lists onto the screen and add new items to the list, except that feature doesn't work currently.
