# Vue-3-Fundamentals

Shane Kennedy

Programming languages: HTML, CSS, VueJS


To better understand Vue and how it works, I created this shopping list app awhile ago. Currently it is not working fully, but I just recently rediscovered I created it. It doesn't make use of any JS files, and I'm not sure if that's to its benefit or if it will cause a problem.

I plan to continue working on it as time goes on to see if I can create this working app without the use of JS files, but obviously JS will still be involved.

*ABOUT THE SHOPPING LIST APP*

I initially created this app to get an understanding of VueJS and how it worked, so I didn't focus to much on making it look nice. Currently its only functionalities are to display hard-coded lists onto the screen and add new items to the list, except that feature doesn't work currently.


*To Do:*
- Create an optional dropdown menu to choose the quantity
- Add optional button to "freeze" a list so that nothing can be added or removed
- Fix the UI (all of it needs reworked)


*Things that won't be done*
- This shopping list is being used to develop my own understanding of and relearn VueJS. Because of this I will not worry about making this app work with varying sized screens. It will be setup to primarily work on a fullscreen window. I will focus on learning the resizing variations at a later date, but currently I want to learn Vue better.
- The overall UI will not end up getting a redesign. Like I said before, I am focusing on Vue with this project, not necessarily making it look nice.
